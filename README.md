## 📖 What is This?

This script **tricks Discord into thinking you're playing a game** to automatically complete quests without actually launching the game. It creates a fake game process that Discord recognizes, allowing you to earn quest rewards effortlessly.

**Perfect for:**
- Completing PLAY/STREAM quests without downloading games
- Earning quest rewards while doing other things
- Saving time and system resources

---

## ✨ Features

- 🎨 **Beautiful animated UI** with smooth transitions
- 🚀 **Auto-detects quests** and tracks progress in real-time
- ⏱️ **Time estimation** with circular progress indicator
- 🔒 **Safe & transparent** - fully open-source code
- 💾 **Zero dependencies** - pure vanilla JavaScript
